# Plateau Rover 3000

This is Plateau Rover 3000 – a retro exploration game best played with others!

## Motivation

The internet is an astounding achievement – its power as a place of fun and learning.

But we live in an attention economy, our precious and finite moments on this earth increasingly saturated and devoured by AI slop and ragebait, all twitching across our screens like the death throes of our dwindling attention spans.

Countermeasures are limited: delete social media accounts, hush a seething news cycle down to a barely audible daily murmur. 
Fixing one problem gives rise to another: isolation.

Plateau Rover 3000 is a celebration of simplicity, slowness and exploration with friends. 
Made by a neurospicy person with a desire to participate in fun and learning on the internet, without sniffing its sloppy and furious whiff.

You are welcome here, fellow earthling.
